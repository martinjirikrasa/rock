Rock, paper, scissors:
Rules:
1. if both players make the same symbol, its a tie
2. paper beats rock
3. rock beats scissors
4. scissors beat paper

How my game works:
I start by declaring the options for the computer, which are rock, paper and scissors and i set players and computers score to 0. After that the player chooses how many wins are enough to win the game( or to lose ). I then loop in a while loop until one of the players wins. In the loop i check the players and copmputers answer and compare then, the programm then chooses a winner according to the rules. I made it so once the game stars, the player just types his choices and i give him immediately answer, if he won the round, lost or it was a tie. After a player played enough games and won or lost, i print a statement if he won or lost and END the game.
